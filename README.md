🚦 Distributed Machine Learning for Road Collision Severity Prediction
1. Project Summary

This project develops a scalable distributed machine learning pipeline to predict road collision severity using large-scale UK road safety data.

Built with Apache Spark (PySpark MLlib), the system processes multi-decade national traffic records and evaluates multiple regression models in a distributed environment.

The solution demonstrates how big data engineering and distributed analytics can support:

Data-driven road safety policy

Emergency response optimization

Infrastructure risk assessment

National-scale transportation analytics

2. Problem Statement

Road traffic collisions create significant social and economic impact. However, traditional statistical approaches face limitations when applied to large national datasets:

Inability to efficiently process large-scale historical data

Poor modeling of nonlinear feature interactions

Limited scalability in centralized environments

This project addresses these issues by designing a distributed machine learning architecture capable of scalable and accurate severity prediction.

3. Research Objectives

Identify the model with the highest predictive accuracy.

Evaluate computational efficiency of distributed training.

Analyse scalability trade-offs (strong vs weak scaling).

Investigate nonlinear patterns affecting collision severity.

Assess performance vs infrastructure cost trade-offs.
